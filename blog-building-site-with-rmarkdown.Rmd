> There _may_ be [documentation](rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html) availible [GitHub](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/tree/gh-pages) to the `<head>`  simple(text file <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></i> blog).

### QUICK ASIDE---FEEL FREE TO SKIP
<br>

1. [RStudio Preview Release](www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/) so you can get the 'build' pane
2. `rmarkdown` (v0.9.6) which you can install from CRAN thusly:



```css
#rbmvFooter {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 2;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  height: 25em;
}

```

#### PUT SOME GGPLOT IN A POST!

<br>

The most rewarding part about writing blog posts in `rmarkdown` is that you can really dive into an analysis workflow and it is automagically a blog post.  It's so easy---you just leave your code chunk as is or pass `eval = F` if you just want to show some code[^9] or `echo = F` to hide or display code the way you want to.

<br>

<br>

This is _italics_ and :

<br>

> <i class="fa fa-quote-left fa-1x"></i> Here we have a quote block with a reference [^1] <i class="fa fa-quote-right fa-1x"></i>

<br>


<br>

```{r setup, include=F}
1+1
```

This was _quite_ a journey for me.  I started the same way everyone else
has; with my very _first_ "Hello World" program written in Python 3:


```{r setup2, echo=F}
1+1
```

<br>

```{r}
1+1
```

<br>

* A list
* A sublist:
    - Item1
    - Item2
    
<br>

<br>

I always feel that it is important to highlight the path I took to get to the point where I am--the _non-traditional_ route, which begs the question, _"what is the traditional route to data science?"_ Rather than go down a semantics rabbit hole I'd rather point out some of the raw ingredients that, at least I believed when I started down this path, make it _easier_ to get into data science/analysis:

<br>

<ul>
  <li>`r icon::fa("angle-double-right")` A good working knowledge of computer science (concepts and practical experience)</li>
</ul>
